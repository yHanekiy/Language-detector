The flora of Ukraine impresses with its richness and diversity. It is called in one word - flora. There was such a Greek goddess of flowers, spring, and fun. According to botanists, the entire flora of Ukraine has four and a half thousand species! This does not include algae, fungi, and lichens.
So, Ukraine is one of the densely populated and human-developed corners of the planet. Under the influence of human activity, the flora of Ukraine suffers and undergoes changes. There are fewer and fewer endemic plants (that is, plants that live only in one place on the planet). Askania Nova, our unique nature reserve, is losing ground every year, the arboretum is getting smaller and smaller, new plant species are not taking root, and old ones are dying out. And yet it depends on us - people!
Nowadays, the protection of the plant world depends only on us, and it depends on us what we will pass on to our descendants: lush green forests and full-flowing rivers or hectares of desolate land, unable to grow even a yellow ball of a dandelion?...
Telesik
Grandfather and grandmother lived. They have already become old, and there are no children. Grandfather and grandmother grumble: "Who will take care of our death, since we have no children?" So the grandmother asks the grandfather:
- Go, grandfather, to the forest, cut down a piece of wood for me there, and let's make a cradle, then I will put a piece of wood in the cradle and rock it; it will be fun for me!
Grandpa didn't want to at first, but grandma keeps asking and asking. He obeyed, drove off, cut down a piece of wood, made a cradle... The old woman put the piece of wood in the cradle, and she sang a song:
Lyuli-lyuli, Telesyku,
Cooked a dumpling,
I will feed you.
Rocked and rocked until they went to bed in the evening. They get up in the morning - all the way from that village and the little son became. They were so happy that it is impossible to say! And they named that son Telesyk.
That son grows and grows - and he has become so handsome that grandmother and grandfather are not pleased with him.
As he grew up, he says:
"Daddy, make me a golden boat and a silver rainbow, I'll catch fish and feed you!"
The grandfather made a golden boat and a silver rainbow, lowered it onto the river, and he set off. So here he goes along the river, catches fish and feeds his grandfather and grandmother, catches and gives back - and leaves again. And his mother brings him food. And he says:
- Look, son, when I call, then swim to the shore, and if someone is a stranger, then swim further!
So the mother cooked him breakfast, brought it to the shore and called:
Telesik, Telesik!
Come, come to the shore!
I will give you food and drink!
Telesyk heard.
"Closer, closer, boatman, to the shore!" This is what my mother brought for breakfast.
floats He went to the shore, ate his fill, got drunk, pushed away the golden boat with a silver rainbow and swam further to catch fish.
And the snake overheard how the mother was calling Telesyk, and came to the shore and called out in a thick voice:
Telesik, Telesik!
Come, come to the shore!
I will give you food and drink!
And he hears.
"That's not my mother's voice!" Swim, swim, boat, on! Swim, swim, boat, on!
He waved a rainbow - the boat sailed away. And the snake stood and stood and went away from the shore.
Telesykov's mother cooked him dinner, carried him to the bank and called:
Telesik, Telesik!
Come, come to the shore!
I will give you food and drink!
He heard:
"Closer, closer, boatman, to the shore!" This is what my mother brought me for dinner.
He swam to the shore, ate his fill, got drunk, gave his mother the fish he had caught, pushed the boat away and swam again.
And the snake comes to the shore and again with a thick voice:
Telesik, Telesik!
Come, come to the shore!
I will give you food and drink!
And he heard that it was not his mother's voice, but waved his rainbow:
- Swim, swim, boat, on! Swim, swim, boat, on! The shuttle sailed on.
The snake saw that he could not do anything, so he went to the blacksmith:
- Blacksmith, blacksmith! Give me such a thin voice, like Telesykova's mother!
Blacksmith and chained. She went to the shore and began to call:
Telesik, Telesik!
Come, come to the shore!
I will give you food and drink!
And he thought that it was a mother.
"Closer, closer, boatman, to the shore!" My mother brought me food!
And the tide came to the coast. And the snake snatched him from the boat and carried him to his house.
- Zmiyuchko Olenko, open it!
Olenka opened it, and the snake entered the house.
- Snake Olenko, heat the oven so that the stones fall apart, and bake me Telesyka, and I'll go and call the guests, and we'll go for a walk.
Yes, she flew to call the guests.
Olenka heated the stove so that the stones crumbled, and then she said:
- Sit down, Telesyk, on the shovel! And he says:
- When I don't know how to sit him down?
- Sit down already! - says Olenka. He put his hand on the shovel.
- So? he says.
- No, sit down! He put his head down:
- So, maybe?
- No, no, no! Sit down, everyone!
- Of course? Is that so? - and put his foot down.
- Oh no, - says Olenka, - no, not like that!
- Well, show it like that, - says Telesyk, - because I don't know how. She began to show, but she just sat down, and he grabbed a shovel and threw her into the stove, and closed the stove with a shutter, and he locked the house himself, climbed on a very tall sycamore tree and sat down. A snake flies with guests.
- Zmiyuchko Olenko, open it!
Not a little.
- Zmiyuchko Olenko, open it!
Doesn't say anything.
— Olenka's impression has already faded somewhere.
The snake itself opened the house, the guests came and sat down at the table. The snake opened the flap, took it out of the oven, and ate it - they thought it was Telesyk. They had a good meal, went outside and rolled on the grass.
— I'll roll, I'll fall, having eaten my fill of Telesyko's meat!
And Telesyk made of sycamore:
- Roll, fall down, having had enough of Olenchy's meat!
They are listening... Where is it? But again:
— I'll roll over, I'll fall down, having eaten my fill of Telesyk's meat.
And he again:
- Roll, fall down, having had enough of Olenchy's meat!
They are further:
- What is it?
Let's look, let's look, and they saw Telesyk on the sycamore tree. They rushed to the sycamore and began to bite it. Grizzlies gnawed until their teeth were broken, but they won't bite. Rushed to the blacksmith:
- Blacksmith, blacksmith, give us such teeth to bite through that sycamore!
Blacksmith and chained. They just started again... They're about to bite. When a flock of geese flies. Telesik asks them:
Geese, geese, goslings!
Take me under your wings
But take it to my father,
And in my father's day
eat and drink
It's also good to walk!
And the geese say:
- Let the average ones take you!
And the snakes gnaw-gnaw... Until a flock of geese flies again. Telesyk and asks:
Geese, geese, goslings!
Take me under your wings
But take it to my father,
And eat and drink in my father's day,
It's also good to walk!
So they say to him:
- Let the rear take you!
And the sycamore is cracking. The snakes will rest and bite again, they will rest and again... Even a flock of geese is still flying. Telesyk asks them like this:
Geese, geese, goslings!
Take me under your wings
But take it to my father,
And eat and drink in my father's day,
It's also good to walk!
And they say:
- Let the rear take you!
And they flew.
The hearty Telesik is sitting, and the sycamore will fall, and you will have to perish! When it flies to itself one gander: it bounced off - flies with difficulty, Telesyk to him:
